# Anthropic: Claude 3 Haiku (self-moderated)Self-moderated variant

This is a lower-latency version of [Claude 3 Haiku](/models/anthropic/claude-3-haiku), made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the model's side instead of OpenRouter's. It's in beta, and may change in the future.
[Claude 3 Haiku](/models/anthropic/claude-3-haiku) is Anthropic's fastest and most compact model for
near-instant responsiveness. Quick and accurate targeted performance.
