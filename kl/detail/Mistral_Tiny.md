# Mistral Tiny

This model is currently powered by Mistral-7B-v0.2, and incorporates a "better" fine-tuning than [Mistral 7B](/models/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct), inspired by community work. It's best used for large batch processing tasks where cost is a significant factor but reasoning capabilities are not crucial.
