# Anthropic: Claude 3 Sonnet（自行管理）自行管理变种

This is a lower-latency version of [Claude 3 Sonnet](/models/anthropic/claude-3-sonnet), made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the model's side instead of OpenRouter's. It's in beta, and may change in the future.
[Claude 3 Sonnet](/models/anthropic/claude-3-sonnet) is an ideal balance of intelligence and speed for enterprise workloads. Maximum utility at a lower price, dependable, balanced for scaled deployments.
