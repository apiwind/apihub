# Anthropic: Claude 3 Opus (self-moderated)Self-moderated variant

This is a lower-latency version of [Claude 3 Opus](/models/anthropic/claude-3-opus), made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the model's side instead of OpenRouter's. It's in beta, and may change in the future.
[Claude 3 Opus](/models/anthropic/claude-3-opus) is Anthropic's most powerful model for highly complex tasks. It boasts top-level performance, intelligence, fluency, and understanding.
