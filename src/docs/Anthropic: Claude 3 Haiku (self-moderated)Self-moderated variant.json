            "description": "This is a lower-latency version of [Claude 3 Haiku](/models/anthropic/claude-3-haiku), made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the model's side instead of OpenRouter's. It's in beta, and may change in the future.\n[Claude 3 Haiku](/models/anthropic/claude-3-haiku) is Anthropic's fastest and most compact model for\nnear-instant responsiveness. Quick and accurate targeted performance.\nSee the launch announcement and benchmark results [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-haiku)\n#multimodal"
